        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I've always had a passion for tech. From building custom pc's in my
          youth to running a business deploying surveillance equipment after
          college, cutting edge technology has been where my heart is.
        </p>
        <p>
          More recently, however, I've gravitated towards the software end of
          things and fell in love with the world of web development. I find it
          particularly fulfilling to take a concept or design out of the
          imagination and turn it into new software. It's fun to create!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have been trading stocks and foreign exchange for the past
          several years now, so most of my time outside of coding is spent
          studying financial markets or watching or playing sports for
          recreation and fitness. It's great mentally to rotate and switch
          gears with different tasks to remain fresh and sharp within each.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a new dev, I'm eager, and thanks to
          <a href="http://www.thinkful.com " target="_blank">Thinkful</a>,
          able to deliver quality software and web applications, and with new
          apps, features and frameworks being constantly introduced, I'm sure
          to be immersed for quite a while. I'm looking forward to working
          with future clients and especially fellow developers on exciting and
          challenging new projects.
